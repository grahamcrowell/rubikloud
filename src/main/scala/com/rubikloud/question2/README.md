# Question 2

[Back to root README](../../../../../../README.md)

Pick any two datasets and join them using SparkSQL API. Feel free to pick any two datasets. For example: PART and PARTSUPP. The goal of this exercise is not to derive anything meaningful out of this data but to demonstrate how to use Spark to join two datasets. For this problem you're NOT allowed to use the DataFrame, DataSet or RDD API. You can only use SparkSQL API. You can use either Python or Scala to solve this problem.
