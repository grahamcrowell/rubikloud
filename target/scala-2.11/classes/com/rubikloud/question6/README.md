# Question 6
We have a new dataset which is the delta for the table created in Questions # 5. This delta file has record for Jan-2018 and Feb-2018. Update the external table with two months of data, making sure the rest of the partitions are not affected, you want to write code which will perform the fastest incurring minimal writes to the storage layer.
